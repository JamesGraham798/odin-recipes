    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breast</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalter butter</li>
        <li>2 Tsp seasame or vegtable oil</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp low sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2(3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp gochujang</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375â„‰. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>
            Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately. Enjoy!!
