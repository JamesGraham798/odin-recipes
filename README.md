# Odin-Recipes

This is a project that will allow me to show all that I have learned so far about HTML.

This project is a recipe page, that has 3 different recipes of well known foods that you can recreate yourself.

<b>Here are a list of HTML concepts that I will apply in this project:</b>
- Attributes
- Links
- Images
- Overall HTML file structure
